## INTRODUCTION ##
These codes were developed during my Thesis work where I perfmored a good number of simulation with the Planet Simuator Model (PlaSim). This Climate Model is open source and you can find the original version [here](https://github.com/HartmutBorth/PlaSim). However, during this project I started from another version [here](https://github.com/jhardenberg/plasim). Even if the code in this repository was used for the former model I believe that with some tips can be be performed for other model that save their data in Netcdf format. In the following part I will explain how to use the code. This is far for perfection and could be some unclear things and error. Feel free to open issues in that case.

## PRE-REQUISITES ##
In this code a I've used the Anaconda distribution with Jupyter Notebook (expet for the file in CDO and application) and the script requires the following packages:
-netcdf
-cdo
-basemap
-cartopy
