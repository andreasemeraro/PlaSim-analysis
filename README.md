## INTRODUCTION ##
These codes were developed during my Thesis work where I perfmored a good number of simulation with the Planet Simuator Model (PlaSim). This Climate Model is open source and you can find the original version [here](https://github.com/HartmutBorth/PlaSim). However, during this project I started from another version [here](https://github.com/jhardenberg/plasim).
